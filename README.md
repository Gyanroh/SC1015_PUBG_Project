# Mini-Project for SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
---
## Introduction
The gaming industry is a prime area for data exploration and extraction due to massive datasets and online characteristics. We can get great insight on the decision-making and logic that individual players experience and utilize when put in hypothetical and virtual scenarios like games.

In this project, we provide over 13,000,000 player data inputs from the popular game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. The relevant data presented was extracted from the website [pubg.op.gg](http://pubg.op.gg), a game tracker website that directly collects data from PlayerUnknown's Battleground's API. We proceed to explore and visualize this data, and further create predictive models (INSERT WHAT TYPE OF MODEL HERE @FRASER).
